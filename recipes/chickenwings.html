        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>Basic Crispy Baked Chicken Wings</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place a wire rack onto a baking sheet. Use paper towels to pat chicken wings as dry as possible and place into a large mixing bowl.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, stir together baking powder, salt, pepper, and paprika (and any additional flavor additions you'd like to use). Sprinkle over chicken wings and toss until wings are evenly coated.</li>
                    <li>Place wings in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered overnight, 12 to 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Take wings directly from refrigerator and roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, until crispy and brown and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Cooking time will vary based on the size of your chicken wings.</li>
                    <li>Serve plain hot, or use desired flavor sauces and variations.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Buffalo Sauce</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together hot sauce, melted butter, and honey.</li>
                    <li>Add cooked chicken wings to a large mixing bowl. Pour in sauce and toss to coat.</li>
                </ol>
